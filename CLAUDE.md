This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a photography portfolio website designed to showcase and sell photography prints. The project is a multi-page static website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a complete e-commerce shopping cart system and Stripe integration.

## Architecture

- **Multi-page Frontend**: Static website with multiple pages and no backend dependencies
- **Gallery System**: JavaScript-driven photo gallery with filtering and lightbox functionality
- **Complete E-commerce System**: Full shopping cart with localStorage persistence and Stripe payment integration
- **Admin Panel**: Password-protected interface for photo management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Development Commands

Since this is a static website, no build process is required. Simply open `index.html` in a browser for development.

For production deployment:
- Update Stripe publishable keys in `assets/js/script.js` and `assets/js/cart.js`
- All assets should be optimized
- Images should be compressed and sized appropriately
- Consider using a CDN for image delivery

## Gallery Data Structure

Photos are managed in the `photos` array in `assets/js/script.js`:
```javascript
{
  id: unique_id,
  src: "assets/images/category/filename.jpg",
  title: "Photo Title",
  category: "landscape|street",
  price: "$50",
  description: "Photo description"
}
```

## Cart Data Structure

Cart items are stored in localStorage as:
```javascript
{
  photoId: number,
  photoTitle: string,
  photoSrc: string,
  printSize: "8x10|11x14|16x20",
  price: number,
  quantity: number
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture (`server.js`):
- **Express.js Server** on port 3001
- **Stripe Payment Intents API** for secure payment processing
- **CORS enabled** for frontend-backend communication
- **Environment variable security** for API keys
- **Health check endpoint** for monitoring
- **Webhook support** for payment event handling

### Payment Flow:
1. Frontend collects customer and payment information
2. Creates payment intent via `/create-payment-intent` endpoint
3. Stripe Elements handles secure card processing
4. Server confirms payment and handles success/failure

### Environment Variables:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (from Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (from Stripe Dashboard)
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Development Workflow

### Local Development:
1. `npm install` - Install dependencies
2. Configure `.env` with Stripe test keys
3. `npm run dev` - Start development server
4. Open `index.html` in browser for frontend

### Testing:
- Use Stripe test card numbers (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Server health check: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Payment processing endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/create-payment-intent`

## Next Steps for Production

### Immediate (Ready to Deploy):
1. **Get Stripe Account**: Sign up and get test API keys
2. **Test Payment Flow**: Verify complete checkout process
3. **Custom Domain**: Already configured for Netlify deployment

### Production Deployment:
1. **Server Hosting**: Deploy Node.js server (Heroku, Railway, or Netlify Functions)
2. **Live Stripe Keys**: Switch from test to production keys
3. **Environment Variables**: Set production secrets in hosting platform
4. **CORS Update**: Add production domain to allowed origins
5. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS for payment security

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Order Management**: Database for order tracking
2. **Email Notifications**: Automated confirmation emails
3. **Print Fulfillment**: Integration with printing service
4. **Inventory Management**: Stock tracking system
5. **Analytics**: Sales and performance tracking
